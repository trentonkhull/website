<h2></h2>
  <p>Veteran crooner Trenton Hull has built his music career in Dallas/Ft. Worth <br> 
    as a man with more than a couple hats, performing with pop and party bands,<br> 
    playing small jazz venues, playing synthesizers in electronic bands,<br> 
    and he is a regular Dallas-area studio singer. He’s sung background vocals for Ben Folds,<br> 
    and Sarah Brightman. He still draws on memories from his time at the University of North Texas,<br> 
    where he studied Vocal Jazz, and was named Downbeat Magazine’s Undergrad Vocalist of the Year in 2012.<br> 
    For Trenton, nothing beats the thrill of making music with any of the amazingly talented Dallas musicians <br>
    he’s come to know as friends.</p>
